The `scipy.signal` library contains the [`find_peaks`][sp-find_peaks] function which allows us to automatically grab peaks. The automation can be trained on a number of parameters. We'll use the `prominence` and `height` parameters to exclude \"peaks\" in the baseline and keep us from grabbing peaks that are too close to each other (_i.e.,_ if a peak has a slight shoulder, both points might be chosen). \n",

Each of the packages used has a wealth of documentation ([NumPy][np], [SciPy][sp], [Matplotlib][mpl], and [StackExchange][sx] has a wealth of knowledge (answers are often in the top of search results for a given topic). If you're still having problems, feel free to ask your classmates in the Teams channel for the lab (text or voice/screensharing). I'm also happy to try to help, but you'll be at the mercy of my schedule, which might be hectic for the next week or so. \n",
